# Weekly Study Planner: A guide to full filling your projectâ€™s ultimate goal


## Project Statement

Many students struggle to manage many assignments, projects, deadlines and academic related activities in a week . If we don't have a clear schedule and organized dates to when it should be passed it would lead to many missed tasks, assignments stacking up, stress and pressure. Which is why we need a weekly reminder for us to remember and have an organized schedule about our assignments by sorting them to which are more important or closer to due dates to have a more clean schedule and manage time easier.

## Project objectives 

Help students track projects and mark tasks completed if finished.

Automatically sorts tasks by prioritizing the more important ones.

Allow users to add tasks with subject, due date, and how important it is. 

Provide a weekly view of tasks grouped by day.

Send reminders for upcoming deadlines.

## Planned Features 

The Weekly Study Planner will include weekly task scheduling with support for upcoming activities. It is an intelligent priority suggestion system that ranks tasks based on urgency, and it will also provide customizable reminders for upcoming deadlines. It will feature a progress tracking dashboard to monitor completed and pending tasks, and finally adaptive rescheduling to adjust plans when delays occur. In short, it is a simple user-friendly interface that will ensure accessibility across devices, helping students stay organized and focused throughout the week.
